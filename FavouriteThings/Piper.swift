                Just under three years ago, my family welcomed a new member to our pack: Piper!

                Piper as a puppy packed a lot of pep! She was full of energy. While we were fortunate that she never showed much interest in chewing the furniture – something young Labradors are known for – she had no such compunction about my ankles. There was a period when she was about 10 weeks old where I would only go in the kitchen – the part of the house she was limited to at first – when wearing knee high rainboots. Protection. 😅

                My family thinks Piper at any age was adorable, but as a puppy she definitely had her moments. A favourite memory is watching Piper chew a stick with her "best friend"... the yellow Labrador who lives next door and is about five years older than Piper.

                These days Piper has slowed down a bit (she loves to sleep on our couch) but when she goes out for a walk (often at Northcote) she will tear around with complete abandon.

                We love Piper very much. 🥰
